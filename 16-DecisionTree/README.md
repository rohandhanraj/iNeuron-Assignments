# Decision Tree Assignment

## Predicting Survival in the Titanic Data Set

We will be using a decision tree to make predictions about the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This data set provides information on the Titanic passengers and can be used to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Loading Data and modules

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sb
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn
from pandas import Series, DataFrame
from pylab import rcParams
from sklearn import preprocessing
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigDataGal/Python-for-Data-Science/master/titanic-train.csv'

titanic = pd.read_csv(url)

titanic.columns =
['PassengerId','Survived','Pclass','Name','Sex','Age','SibSp','Parch','Ticket','Fare','Cabin','Embarked']
```

**You use only Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp (Siblings aboard), Parch (Parents/children aboard), and Fare to predict whether a passenger survived.**
